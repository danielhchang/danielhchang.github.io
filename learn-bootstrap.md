# Examples:

I learned of Bootstrap when I took the udemy [jekyll](https://www.udemy.com/static-website-generator-fast-secure-sites-blogs-with-jekyll) course.  

This bootstrap [introductory course](https://www.udemy.com/bootstrap-4-beginners-code-a-responsive-landing-page/) on udemy is taught by [Andy Clarke](https://www.udemy.com/user/andyclarke6/).  It uses bs4, fontawesome v4.7.0, google fonts, animate.css, and wow.js to demonstrate to students how to create a dynamic landing page.  The course only delves in the formatting and presentation; there are forms, but these are merely templates and aren't connected to any databases to collect/store the details but the course author promises to review those in a separate course.

My impression of Bootstrap is that it makes it easy to code webpages for multiple devices and screen sizes.  

Using Google Fonts is really easy.  Just go to (https://fonts.google.com) and pick the font(s) you want then insert the line in your index.html.  In the udemy course, the Alegreya Sans font is used and light, regular and bold versions are incorporated. <br>
